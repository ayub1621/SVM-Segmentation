## Introduction
Image segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves dividing an image into multiple segments or regions to simplify the analysis and understanding of the image content. This program utilizes Support Vector Machines (SVM) for image segmentation, a popular machine learning algorithm known for its effectiveness in classification tasks.

By training an SVM model on a labeled dataset of segmented images, the program learns to classify pixels or regions within an image. The segmented regions can then be used for further analysis or visualization.

The program is implemented in Python, leveraging machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn. Jupyter Lab provides an interactive environment for running and exploring the program.

## Installation
To run this program, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3
- Jupyter Lab
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Scipy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- Pandas

You can install these dependencies using `pip` by running the following command:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab scikit-learn numpy matplotlib opencv-python scipy pandas
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayub1621/SVM-Segmentation.git
cd SVM-Segmentation
```

## Usage
1. Launch Jupyter Lab by running the following command in the project directory:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

2. In Jupyter Lab, open the `SVM_Segmentation.ipynb` notebook.

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load and preprocess the dataset, train the SVM model, and perform image segmentation on test images.

4. Customize the SVM parameters, feature extraction techniques, and training strategy based on your requirements. You can experiment with different kernel functions, feature descriptors, and hyperparameter values to achieve better segmentation results.

5. Run the code cells in the notebook to execute the program, visualize the segmentation results, and evaluate the performance of the SVM model.

## Results
The program aims to segment images into meaningful regions or objects using the SVM model. The quality of the segmentation depends on factors such as the quality and diversity of the training dataset, the selection of appropriate features, and the effectiveness of the SVM model training.

You can evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or Intersection over Union (IoU). Additionally, you may consider exploring alternative segmentation algorithms, post-processing techniques, or incorporating deep learning approaches for improved segmentation results.
